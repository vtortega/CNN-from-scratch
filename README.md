# Basics of CNN

Both CNNs are not running with consistency yet, I amg having some troubles with the files. Sometimes it reads a jpeg with no problems, sometimes it just cant read it.
I am working on the solution now and as fast as possible, but the rest seems ok

Reviewing the basics of CNNs. With this I wanted to get used to creating Custom Datasets and Creating the Layers of the CNN by hand and try to choose the best loss function.

Focusing an transforms too, playing with data typs and all those elemetns of simple Nets so that, when very familiar with the basics, the more advanced will come easier

All is done with a file with pictures of cats and dogs for classification
